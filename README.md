Welcome on the GitHub of the OlaFresco projet. _We_'re developping a website for the company OlaFresco.
We're working for the startup _Aloha_ Digital Factory.

### We

We're four Junior Webdevelopers. Nathan Gemis is the designer, Jeremy Vantighem is the manager and the problem solver, Michel Deraemaeker is the content (and tables) manager and Damian Szacun is the back-end developer.

### The project

It will be a food ordering website. Our development goal is to make it interesting and intuitive enough for the client to spend time choosing his meals. We will manipulate space and images in order to make it clear and catchy.


### Our concept

While doing our brainstorming we found a nice idea for the website. The meals will be filtered by default: by countries they are from and by the users rating. And if that doesn't suit the users needs he will have advanced filters for allergies, meat/vegan options and so on.
