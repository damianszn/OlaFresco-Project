# OlaFresco-Project

Welcome on the GitHub of the OlaFresco projet. *We*'re developping a website for the company OlaFresco.

### We

We're four Junior Webdevelopers working for the startup Aloha Digital Factory. Nathan Gemis is the designer, Jeremy Vantighem is the manager, Michel Deraemaeker is the content (and tables) manager and Damian Szacun is the back-end developer.

### The project

It will be a food ordering website. Our development goal is to make it interesting and intuitive enough for the client to spend time choosing his meals. We will manipulate space and images in order to make it clear and catchy.
